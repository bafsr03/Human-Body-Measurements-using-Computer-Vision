Getting human body measurements from single image is a very hard problem. This repository provides a starting solution for any one who is working in this domain.
It maps single input image onto 3-dimientional model using 3D human reconstruction
## Inference
`python3 inference.py -i <path to Image1> -ht <height in cm>`
